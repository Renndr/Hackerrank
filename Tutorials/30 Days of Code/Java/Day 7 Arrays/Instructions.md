# Objective
Today, we will learn about the Array data structure. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

## Task
Given an array, `arr`, of integers, print `arr`'s elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

## Example
Print `2 3 4 1`. Each integer is separated by one space.

## Input Format
The first line contains an integer, `n` (the size of our array).
The second line contains space-separated integers that describe array `arr`'s elements.

### Constraints
- Constraints

, where `arr[i]` is the `i`-th integer in the array.

## Output Format
Print the elements of array `arr` in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

## Sample Input
```
