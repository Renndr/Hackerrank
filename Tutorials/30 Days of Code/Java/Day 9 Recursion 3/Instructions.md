# Objective
Today, we are learning about an algorithmic concept called recursion. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

## Recursive Method for Calculating Factorial

### Function Description
Complete the `factorial` function in the editor below. Be sure to use recursion.

`factorial` has the following parameter:

- `int n`: an integer

**Returns**

- `int`: the factorial of `n`

**Note:** If you fail to use recursion or fail to name your recursive function `factorial` or `Factorial`, you will get a score of `0`.

### Input Format

A single integer, `n` (the argument to pass to `factorial`).

### Constraints

Your submission must contain a recursive function named `factorial`.

### Sample Input

```
3
```

### Sample Output

```
6
```

**Explanation:**

Consider the following steps. After the recursive calls from step 1 to 3, results are accumulated from step 3 to 1.
```
1. factorial(3) = 3 x factorial(2) = 3 x 2 = 6
2. factorial(2) = 2 x factorial(1) = 2 x 1 = 2
3. factorial(1) = 1
```
